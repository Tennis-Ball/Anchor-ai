Anchor was one of my first-ever medium-large projects, a place of great learning and fun. Anchor was built on the Django web framework and hosted on Heroku.
The predictions come from a sophisticated multiple regression model, taking in various inputs from a Yahoo finance API. Training runs daily in an AWS EC2 instance, providing predictions for over 5,000 symbols. With an AWS S3 hosted static directory, Anchor can pull these predictions instantaneously, providing users with instant information.
